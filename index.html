            <h4>My Experiences</h4>
            <p>I am a current fourth-year student studying data science and health science with a minor in computational social sciences. 
                Some of my favorite classes that I have taken during the past 4 years include Machine Learning and Data Mining, 
                Foundations of Biostatistics, Big Data for Cities, and Healthcare Policy and Administration! I am excited to see what 
                classes I will be taking during my next semester. I will be graduating from Northeastern University in the Spring of 
                2025 with a Bachelor of Science!</p>
            <p>During the past few years, I have had the opportunity to work at a few different places,
                allowing me to learn about what I am passionate in and what I may want to pursue as a career after graduation. These companies 
                include Lyndra, Massachusetts General Hospital, Biogen, and even Northeastern University. At these experiences, I learned a lot about 
                various techinal and soft skills that will be invaluable to me in the future. </p>
            <h4>My Interests/Hobbies</h4>
            <p>My interests and hobbies include teaching myself how to play guitar & piano, generative AI & prompt engineering, cooking, running, 
                listening to podcasts, and reading. If you're interested in some of the recent books and podcasts that I have recently read or 
                listened to, check out the Recommendations tab!</p>
