            <h2>My Passions</h2>
            <p>I am interested in cooking, reading, and enjoying the outdoors. I love to try new seasonal recipes, such as pumpkin and cinnamon flavors in the fall. Some of the books I have read recently include Dune, The Silent Patient, and Circe. Lastly, I am looking forward to exploring new places to hike in and around Boston!</p>
