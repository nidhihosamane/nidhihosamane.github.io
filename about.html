                    <img src="dune.jpg">
                    <p>Description: Set on the desert planet Arrakis, Dune is the story of the boy Paul Atreides, 
                        heir to a noble family tasked with ruling an inhospitable world where the only thing of 
                        value is the “spice” melange, a drug capable of extending life and enhancing consciousness. 
                        Coveted across the known universe, melange is a prize worth killing for. When House Atreides is betrayed, 
                        the destruction of Paul’s family will set the boy on a journey toward a destiny greater than he 
                        could ever have imagined. And as he evolves into the mysterious man known as Muad’Dib, he will 
                        bring to fruition humankind’s most ancient and unattainable dream.</p>

                    <p>Description: In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. 
                        But Circe is a strange child--neither powerful like her father nor viciously alluring like her mother. 
                        Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power: 
                        the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.</p>
